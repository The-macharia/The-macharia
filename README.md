Greetings, fellow code aficionados! 👋 I'm `Eric`, a passionate software engineer with a knack for turning caffeine into code. 🚀

## 🌐 Tech Stack

- **Languages:** Python, HTML, CSS
- **Frameworks:** Odoo, Flask, Django, Vue.js
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis
- **Tools:** Celery, RabbitMQ, Jenkins, Github Actions

I breathe life into your projects with Python, sculpt the front end with Vue.js, and weave it all together with the magic of Flask. My expertise extends to the realm of business applications with Odoo, ensuring your software works flawlessly and looks good.

## 💻 What I Bring to the Table

- **Code That Speaks Volumes:** I write code that not only runs efficiently but also tells a story. Because in the end, every line of code is a story waiting to be told.
  
- **Database Mastery:** Whether it's relational data in PostgreSQL, NoSQL in MongoDB, or lightning-fast key-value storage in Redis, I ensure your data is handled with precision.
  
- **Fluent in RabbitMQ and Celery:** As fluent in message queuing as I am in Python. RabbitMQ and Celery are my partners in crime when it comes to handling tasks asynchronously.

- **Web Wizardry:** HTML and CSS are not just acronyms for me; they're the paintbrushes I use to craft elegant and intuitive user interfaces.

## 🏆 Achievements

- **Code Juggernaut:** Juggled multiple projects simultaneously, leaving no bug uncrushed and no feature unimplemented.

- **Checkmate Champion:** When not debugging code, I'm making strategic moves on the chessboard. A coding genius and a chess grandmaster - I know how to dominate on and off the board.

Let's write some code, crack a few jokes, and maybe even challenge each other to a game of chess! 👾💻🔥 -> [Chess Profile♟️](https://www.chess.com/member/ndikwenda)
